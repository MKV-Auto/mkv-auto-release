# MKV Auto

**The ultimate self-hosted solution for automated disc ripping, intelligent processing, and seamless media transfer.**

We're building something extraordinary. MKV Auto will streamline your disc workflow from insertion to organized media files—with automatic detection, [TheDiscDB](https://thediscdb.com) lookup, and support for local, rsync, SMB, and NFS transfers.

## Launching Soon

- **Docker image:** [GitHub Container Registry – mkv-auto-release](https://github.com/MKV-Auto/mkv-auto-release/pkgs/container/mkv-auto-release)
- **Source:** [mkv-auto-release](https://github.com/MKV-Auto/mkv-auto-release)

Progress toward our first release is tracked in [site/progress.json](site/progress.json). The brand site and other frontends consume this file for live progress.
